## Introduction üåü

Breast cancer is a significant global health issue, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. AI4BCancer focuses on utilizing cutting-edge deep learning architectures to analyze and classify breast cancer, offering a powerful tool for medical professionals.

## Dataset üìä

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the [Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data), a comprehensive collection of breast cancer images with corresponding labels. This dataset ensures a diverse and representative set of cases for robust deep learning model training.
